  <p class="lh-copy w-50 center pa5">
    Mars is the logical next step in human space exploration. Just as the Moon
    was a giant step for humankind in the 1960s and provided generations with
    inspiration to dream big and do great things, human Mars exploration will do
    that during my lifetime. We have the capability to send humans to Mars, and
    even more importantly, we have the obligation to do so. It is our duty to
    take on this challenge whole-heartedly, to inspire a new generation of kids
    to stay curious, and in doing so, to create a better future. We are the Mars
    generation, and this is our future.

    After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system due to
    several reasons: - Its soil contains water to extract - It isnâ€™t too cold or
    too hot - There is enough sunlight to use solar panels - Gravity on Mars is
    38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the
    human body to adapt to - It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers
    protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation - The day/night rhythm is very
    similar to ours here on Earth: a Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds
    <br>
    The only other two celestial bodies in orbits near the Earth are our Moon and
    Venus. There are far fewer vital resources on the Moon, and a Moon day takes
    a month. It also does not have an atmosphere to form a barrier against radiation.
