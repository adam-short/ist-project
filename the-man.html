      Elon Musk gives dedication its meaning; a visionary who lives in the future
      and gives every waking moment he has to bringing it to fruition. Born on
      June 28th, 1971 in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, Elon has a younger
      brother and sister. At the age of 17 Elon was accepted into Queen's University
      in Kingston for undergraduate study. In 1992, after spending several years
      at Queen's he transferred to Pennsylvania; he got a degree in physics and
      economics.

    <p class="lh-copy">
      In 1995 Musk and his brother Kimbal started Zip2 - an internet based 'city
      guide' for the newspaper publishing industry. Compaq acquired Zip2 for
      US$307 million in cash and US$34 million in stock during February 1999.
      Elon Musk walked away with $22 million for his 7% share.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy">
      A month later, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company
      with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with
      PayPal. Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO due to a disagreement
      with other company leaders. In October 2002 Paypal was acquired by eBay for
      US$1.5 billion in stock. <b class="fw6"> Elon Musk made US$165 million. </b>

    <p class="lh-copy mb5">
       After a series of explorations around a mission to mars, Elon Musk founded SpaceX.
       <br>
       And then Tesla.
       <br>
       And then SolarCity.
       <br>
       Elon Musk is a genius serial entrepreneur worth US$17 billion. He wants to
       make Human's a multi-planetary species before his death; and his plan to do it
       is incredible.
